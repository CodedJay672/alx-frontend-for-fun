Different developers have their different excuses for not putting so much effort into meeting the requirement of those who will access this websites, instead the conclude that "the framework will handle it for them". However, it is wrong that visitors do not get their maximum expectations met when they visit our web applications. This is often caused by the developers not putting into consideration all the different means and meathods that users can visit their websites.
