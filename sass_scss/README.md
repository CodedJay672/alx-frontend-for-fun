# Working with Sass
Sass is a systematically awesome stylesheet. This is evident in the role that sass plays in our page styling journey. Sass helps us to perform many things when styling our html page including defining variables, modules, mixins and extensions/inheritance. This framework makes it easier to write styles for our pages. We can nest sass selectors the same we nest HTML tags. This allows us to write cleaner css styles which are easier to manage as the files begin to grow.

## Project objectives
1. What Sass means
2. How to write Sass & Scss file
3. What is the difference between Sass and Scss
4. What is the Sass preprocessing
5. How to declare a variable
6. How to use nested definition
7. How to import a Sass file
8. How to use mixins
9. How to declare extend/inheritance styles
10. How to manipulate operators

## Project requirement
This allows us to use only Vim, Vi, emacs editors. Failure to adhere to this requirement will cause the checker to pass the task and throw a permission denied case. This project requires that you have read the resources on sass/scss documentation, and have installed sass successfully. If this has been done, then you can write the codes and compile them into css which can be understood by the browser.
