# Working with Sass
Sass is a systematically awesome stylesheet. This is evident in the role that sass plays in our page styling journey. Sass helps us to perform many things when styling our html page including defining variables, modules, mixins and extensions/inheritance. This framework makes it easier to write styles for our pages. We can nest sass selectors the same we nest HTML tags. This allows us to write cleaner css styles which are easier to manage as the files begin to grow.
